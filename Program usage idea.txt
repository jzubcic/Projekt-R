Program usage idea: 
	-add network components (like so or by using some configuration .txt file?):
		 
		 Subnetwork managementSubnetwork = new Subnetwork();
		 dhcp.addSubnetwork(managementSubnetwork);
		 Subnetwork accountingSubnetwork = new Subnetwork();
		 dhcp.addSubnetwork(accountingSubnetwork);
		 
		 
		 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			managementSubnetwork.addComputer(new Computer(name, ipAddress, operatingSystem, credentials));
		 }
		 
		 ...
		 
	-spawn the worm at some location:

		 NotPetya notPetya = new NotPetya(); 
		 notPetya.startSpread(managementSubnetwork.getPcByIp("192.168.53.11"));
		 	
	-start the thread which will monitor the state of the simulation:

		 SimulationState state = new SimulationState(dhcp); 
		 state.run(); 
		
	-the worm starts spreading, infected computers and computers that have
	 had their data encrypted are printed to user, as well as a notification
	 when the worm can no longer spread
